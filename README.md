# Scrapy---ebay

Scrapy is a fast high-level web crawling and web scraping framework, used to crawl websites and extract structured data from their pages.

In this project I am scraping [ebay](https://www.ebay.com/)

Installation:

`pip install scrapy`

Changing directory from default into the one where I want my project stored:

`cd C:\Users\iraga\OneDrive\Radna povr≈°ina\scr`

Starting my project:

`scrapy startproject ebay1`

After some adjustments in spider code, I ran it via cmd:

`scrapy crawl ebayb`
